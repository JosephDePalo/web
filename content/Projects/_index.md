# JDFTP
A file server and client written in C++. It is currently in development, but
has basic functionality thus far. I am using it to learn more about sockets
programming and C++.

_The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/JosephDePalo/jdftp)_

# Raspberry Pi 4 Home Server
A Raspberry Pi 4 running Debian 12. I use it to host my website and run a VPN server at the moment,
but I am planning on adding more services to it in the future. I am using it to learn more about
system administration and networking. This server also serves as an always-available testing ground
for any technologies I am interested in.
