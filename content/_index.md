Hello! My name is Joseph, a sophomore at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/)
studying computer science. I am interested in cybersecurity, computer networking, distributed
systems, and data engineering.

I usually spend my free time reading, weightlifting, or learning something new. Currently, I am
working on setting up a home lab for self-hosting services and practicing my system administration
and cybersecurity skills.
